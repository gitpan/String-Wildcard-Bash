NAME
    String::Wildcard::Bash - Bash wildcard string routines

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.01 of String::Wildcard::Bash (from
    Perl distribution String-Wildcard-Bash), released on 2014-07-26.

SYNOPSIS
        use String::Wildcard::Bash qw(contains_wildcard);

        say 1 if contains_wildcard(""));      # -> 0
        say 1 if contains_wildcard("ab*"));   # -> 1
        say 1 if contains_wildcard("ab\\*")); # -> 0

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  contains_wildcard($str) => bool
    Return true if $str contains wildcard pattern. Wildcard patterns include
    "*" (meaning zero or more characters), "?" (exactly one character),
    "[...]" (character class), "{...,}" (brace expansion). Can handle
    escaped/backslash (e.g. "foo\*" does not contain wildcard, it's "foo"
    followed by a literal asterisk "*").

    Aside from wildcard, bash does other types of expansions/substitutions
    too, but these are not considered wildcard. These include tilde
    expansion (e.g. "~" becomes "/home/alice"), parameter and variable
    expansion (e.g. $0 and $HOME), arithmetic expression (e.g. "$[1+2]"),
    history ("!"), and so on.

    Although this module has 'Bash' in its name, this set of wildcards
    should be applicable to other Unix shells. Haven't checked completely
    though.

TODO
    Function to parse string and return all the wildcards (with their types,
    positions, ...)

    Function to strip wildcards from string.

    Function to convert to other types of wildcards (and/or to check whether
    it can be represented with other types of wildcards).

    Function to convert a regex pattern to equivalent wildcard?

SEE ALSO
    Regexp::Wildcards to convert a string with wildcard pattern to
    equivalent regexp pattern. Can handle Unix wildcards as well as SQL and
    DOS/Win32. As of this writing (v1.05), it does not handle character
    class ("[...]") and interprets brace expansion differently than bash.

    Other "String::Wildcard::*" modules.
